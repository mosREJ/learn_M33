# plan 
1. read all necessary datasheets:
   1. RM for CortexM4 from ARM site
   2. RM for Cortex M4 from ST 
   3. RM for STM32L4xx family from ST 
   4. ??? LowLayer st datasheet  
2. learn how to use jlink/stlinks commends ie: write/read to/from memmory 
3. learn how to write assembly for cortex/STM32
4. learn how to disasemmlby code
